DESCRIPTION
-----------

The idea behind this theme was to make a clean, versatile theme that has enough
styling to be usable right out of the box. Rather than trying to be everything
to everyone, it is more of a base theme.

Features:

- Lean, mean base theme
- Fully XHTML 1.0 Strict and CSS 2.1 valid
- 3 column collapsible layout
- Fancy blog and comment submission dates
- Large base font size
- Relative font sizes
- Thorough use of CSS inheritance
